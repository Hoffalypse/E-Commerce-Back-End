## Installation
In order to run this program you will need a code editor, either VS code or something similar. Once opening the server.js file, install all dependencies using 'npm i'. From there open the schema.sql file using mysql2 or something similar. After the database is initialized use 'npm run seed' to seed the database with data. Then use 'npm start' from the root file.  

## Usage 
As this is a back-end only app use will need an API design platform such as insomnia to view all the applcable routes. The app is setup for get, post, put and delete routes for the following paths
<p>
- api/categories
- api/products
- api/tags
<p>
Each can also have a "/'interger'" following the route to choose a specific category, product or tag.
